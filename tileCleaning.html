              Cleaning tile floors by yourself is tough and often ineffective
              for deep cleaning. Regular mopping misses the dirt that settles
              deep in your grout lines. Since grout is porous, it absorbs all
              the dirt, grime, and spills, causing your tiles to lose their
              original color
            </p>
            <p>
              Our professional tile and grout cleaning service uses an advanced
              hot water extraction method. This technique is designed to reach
              and remove the hidden dirt, restoring the brightness of your f
              loors. Additionally, our process is proven to remove up to 95% of
              allergens from grout, contributing to a cleaner and healthier

                    To shield your grout lines against mishaps such as minor
                    spills and marks, Capital Carpet Solutions uses a robust
                    clear grout sealant. This finish adds a layer of protection,

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Like carpet, grout is porous and can easily absorb dirt and
                    spills. Our sealant acts as a barrier, making it simpler to
                    clean any spills on your grout before they penetrate the
                    surface

                    color but also includes all the protective qualities of our
                    clear sealant. Plus, you have the option to select a

                MAINTAINING YOUR TILE FLOOR'S LONG-LASTING BEAUTY
              </h5>
              <p class="mb-4">
                To keep your tile floor looking beautiful and to extend the life
                of the sealants, follow these simple care tips:
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Vacuum or sweep before mopping: This helps remove as much dry
                soil as possible, preventing scratches or damage during wet
                cleaning. Always rinse after mopping: This step ensures that no
                cleaning residue is left behind, which could otherwise attract
                more dirt. Stay away from bleach and harsh chemicals: Such
                cleaners can deteriorate the grout and sealants over time. Opt
                for gentler cleaning products to keep your f loors safe and
                intact.

                To effectively clean grout without damaging it, steer clear of
                harsh chemicals like bleach that can degrade sealants. The
                safest and most efficient method is to use a natural grout
                cleaner. <br> <br>
                Here's a simple recipe we recommend: <br><br>
                ●  Mix 1/2 cup of baking soda, 1/4 cup of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 teaspoon of
 dish soap. <br>
 ●  Combine these ingredients well. <br>
 ●  Apply the mixture to the grout and let it sit for 10 minutes. <br>
 ●  Afterward, give it a good scrub and rinse it off. <br> <br>
 This gentle yet effective approach will help keep your grout clean and preserved.

                The need for professional tile and grout cleaning varies, much like with carpets. Several
                factors play a role in determining how often this service is needed: <br> <br>
                Foot Traffic: The amount of daily foot traffic can significantly impact how quickly
                your tiles and grout become dirty. <br>
                Presence of Children and Pets: Homes with children and pets may require more
 frequent cleanings due to additional spills and debris. <br>
 Regular Maintenance: How often and how well you maintain your tile floors also
 affects the frequency of professional cleanings. <br> <br>
 Considering these factors, a general guideline is to have your tile and grout
 professionally cleaned once a year. However, in high-traffic areas or homes with pets
 and children, you might consider more frequent cleanings for optimal maintenance and
 hygiene.
