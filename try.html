                time can change quite a bit based on several factors like the amount of furniture that

                used in the cleaning process isn't fully rinsed out. However, with our cleaning method,
                which involves a specially formulated solution and hot water extraction, we ensure
                minimal to no residue is left behind, reducing the likelihood of rapid resoiling.</div>

                solution deep into the carpet fibers. Then, using powerful suction, we remove
                deep-down dirt, allergens, the cleaning solution, and about 95% of the moisture. This
                method is not only thorough in cleaning but also in ensuring quick drying. It's the
                preferred cleaning technique recommended by most carpet manufacturers due to its

            <div class="accordion-body"> The drying time for your carpet after cleaning depends on several factors, including
                humidity, temperature, and airflow in the cleaned area. Typically, it can take between 1 to
                3 hours for your carpet to dry completely. However, this can vary based on the
                conditions mentioned.  <br>
                To speed up the drying process, you can use fans in the cleaned rooms and adjust your
                air conditioning or heating system, depending on the season. It's important to keep the
                protective blocks under furniture legs and any paper under upholstered items until the
                carpet is fully dry. This prevents any color transfer <br>
                While you can walk on your carpet right after cleaning, it's best to avoid wearing street
                shoes to prevent re-soiling. Clean rubber-soled shoes are a good alternative. Also, be
                cautious when moving from damp carpeted areas to non-carpeted ones, as there's a risk
                of slipping.
